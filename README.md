========

Example Sinatra application used at the Turing School (http://turing.io) for feature testing with Capybara. The lesson can be found here (https://github.com/turingschool/presentations/blob/master/web_applications_with_ruby/feature_testing_with_capybara_and_sinatra.zip).

## Installation

Clone the app, bundle and run it by running `shotgun` in the terminal.

## Branches

There are three branches at three different stages of the Sinatra session.

* `master` contains the initial app without any tests
* `capybara_setup` includes the capybara configuration to make the tests work
* `first_user_test` contains an capybara test example
* `final` includes the final code for the session

## Contributing

If you see anything that you want to improve or that is not working, fork the app, clone it, and submit a pull request. If you don't have the time, open a github issue. Either way, we will appreciate your contribution. :)
